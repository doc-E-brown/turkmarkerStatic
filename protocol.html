        <h1>Mechanical Turk Facial Landmarking Task</h1>
        <p>Please ensure that you read all of these instructions prior to accepting the HIT</p>
        <h2> Description of Task </h2>
        <p>During this task you will be asked to mark the location of a number of features on images of faces; where the
        landmarks are selected from the set shown in the image below. </p>

        <p><img class="center-block" alt="multipie" src="multipie.jpg" style="height: 300px;"></p>

        <p>For each image, the number, order and type of landmarks will vary and will be specified in the <i>Landmark
            Selectors</i> toolbar as seen in the image below.  You will be required to mark each image at least twice
        though there will only be 10 images in total that you will be required to process.  It is estimated that if the
        task is completed correctly it should take approximately 15 - 20 minutes to complete.

        </p>
        
        <h2> User Interface</h2>
        This section describes the user interface that will be used to complete the landmarking task.

        <p><img class="center-block" alt="UI" src="UI.png" style="width: 900px"></p>
        
        <p>The components of the user interface are as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Image for Landmarking:</strong> this is the image that you will be processing, simply click on
                the location in the images corresponding to the closes position of the current specified landmark.</li>
            <li><strong>Example Image:</strong> this generic image is updated for each landmark in the set and is used
                to provide an indication of the approximate location of the current landmark being selected.<u>  DO NOT
                    CLICK ON THIS IMAGE</u>.   You should also notice that the example image illustrates the point that
            is currently selected for positioning (see example above) and when you select a different point the image
            and guidance will change correspondingly.</li>
            <li><strong>Landmark Selectors:</strong>this part of the UI serves two functions: 1. to provide you with the
                list of landmarks to be applied to the image and the order in which they are to be applied and 2. to
                allow you to select each landmark to be processed.  (Note you can use the <code>f</code> keyboard
                shortcut to select the next landmark in the list and the <code>b</code> keyboard shortcut to select the
                previous landmark.</li>
            <li><strong>Progress Bar:</strong> provides an indication of completion progress.</li> 
            <li><strong>Button Panel:</strong> there are three (3) separate buttons in the panel:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Hide / Show All Landmarks:</strong> if previously placed landmarks are obstructing the
                        view of the image to place subsequent landmarks you can click on this button or use the shortcut
                        key <code>h</code> to hide / show all the landmarks except the one being placed.</li>
                    <li><strong>Next Image:</strong>  this button will only be visible when all landmarks for the
                        current image are in valid positions and the landmarking task has been successfully completed
                        for the image.</li>
                    <li><strong>Submit:</strong> this button will only be visible when the entire HIT has been completed
                        and is ready for submission.</li>
                </ul>
            </li> 

        </ul>

        <h2>Landmark Validation</h2>

        <p>The system will check the approximate position of each landmark on the target image.  If the landmark is
        placed in a valid position it will show <strong><font color="green">green</font></strong> in colour, if the
        location is not valid the landmark will be coloured <strong><font color="red">red</font></strong> and a message
        will appear in the dialogue box as shown in the image below.  You will not be able to complete the task until
        all landmarks for all images are in valid positions</p>

        <p><img class="center-block" alt="valid_invalid" src="valid_invalid.png" style="width: 500px"></p>
